EXPLANATION:

These are TextMate syntax highlighting files that work with Sublime Text 2.

I pilfered them from other repos on GitHub, after searching for ones that were compatible.


AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION:

Open terminal and execute this:
bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/MrTin/sublime-text-haml-sass/master/binscripts/curl-installer.sh)


ALTERNATIVE INSTALLATION:

1. On OS X, go to menu bar: "Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Browse Packages..."
   - Alternate method, in Terminal:
   - $ cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages

2. Once that folder is open, close Sublime Text 2.

3. Move the two directories: /Ruby Sass/, and /Ruby Haml/ to that folder.

4. Restart Sublime Text 2.
