EXPLANATION:

TextMate bundles for syntax highlighting, known to work with Sublime Text 2.

I didn't make these. Just threw 'em in a repo, so I'd remember which worked.

Questions & Credit should go to the original authors:

Haml: https://github.com/phuibonhoa/handcrafted-haml-textmate-bundle

Sass: https://github.com/charlesr/ruby-sass-tmbundle


INSTALLATION:

1. On OS X, go to menu bar: "Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Browse Packages..."
   - Alternate method, in Terminal:
   - $ cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages

2. Once that folder is open, close Sublime Text 2.

3. Move the two directories, "/Ruby Sass/" and "/Ruby Haml/" to that folder.

4. Restart Sublime Text 2.
